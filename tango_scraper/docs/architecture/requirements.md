The functional requirements are divided into three different priorities:
| Priority | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| High | These requirements are essential for the system to function properly; without these, there will be a significant impact on the system's ability to provide an enjoyable experience. |
| Medium | These requirements are important but not critical for the system to function properly. |
| Low | These requirements are nice-to-have features that would enhance the system but are not essential for its core functionality. |
